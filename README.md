GraphIt
=======

A small, useful, graphing application for teachers and students.

GraphIt started out as way for me to explore various models that weren't
present in the ModFit application, as well as expanding on the capabilities
of the GraphPanel library.  It has since taken on a life of its own.

How To Use GraphIt:

Start by selecting View | New Function from the top menu bar, then 
select a function (or Function Builder) from the drop-down menu.
Select a color, then have fun!

How To Use Function Builder:

Function Builder is a powerful new way to define your own functions
to play around with.  The Function Builder window is intended to work
like a calculator: similar to reverse-polish notation.  Functions are
tree-like structures built using a depth-first model (from the inside out).
Play around with it, you'll get the hang of it soon enough.
